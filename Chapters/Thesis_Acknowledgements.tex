\hspace{10} This thesis is the end of my journey to obtain a Master Degree in Avionics. These two years have been tough but it became easier due to the support and encouragement of numerous people. \par
First of all, i would like to express my gratefullness to Professor Inês Ribeiro. This work would not have been possible without her guidance. Under her guidance I was able successfully overcome the many difficulties i came accross with and i've learned a lot with that.\\
I am also extremely gratefull to Bruna  Ferreira and Gonçalo Cardeal who provided the help and support to acomplish my work. I am very much thankfull to them for all the feedback and valuable suggestions.\par
The path to my master's degree started with the company of my friend and colleagues. I take this opportunity to say heartfelt thanks to Ana Isabel Ferreira, Mariana Fernandes, João Duarte Prata and Humberto Silva among other friends i met in this instituition, that all of whom had important support to me.\par
Special thanks also to Knowledge Management in Additive Manufacturing (KM3D) that helped me in the project from the beginning, in particular the support for the visit of HyperMetal in Porto, which allowed contact with a real situation of parts production through additive manufacturing studied in this dissection.\par
Finally, i deeply thank to my parents, Anabela and Júlio Remédios for their unconditional trust, timely encouragement and endless patient. To all family, my gratittude, for their love that raised up again when i got weay and everyone of them played an important role during this time.
